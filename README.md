# Apres Ski Hub

Created for the RefactorU Mid-Term project, this application displays the key touchpoints for an outdoor enthusiast looking for a full day's experience - on and off the mountain.  Combines snow and weather report, events & promotions, and traffic conditions; which normally requires at least 3-4 applications.

Developer Tools: AngularJS, JSON, CSS, HTML, Bootstrap.
